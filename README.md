# TES-tools
Tools for TES: Arena and Daggerfall that I wrote for fun and/or convenience. The older Elder Scrolls (Â© 1993-2015 Bethesda Softworks LLC) games seemed to be lacking in Linux support, so these scripts are intended to help in that regard.


arena.sh
This is a makeself script for the installation of The Elder Scrolls I: Arena. To create the self-extracting shell script:

Place the Arena archive and arena.sh in the same directory ("~/project/files" in this example). Make sure "arena.sh" is executable.
From "~/project", execute the following: 'makeself makeself files/ arenaInstall.sh "Arena Installer for Linux" ./arena.sh'
You should now have an executable, self-extracting archive called "arenaInstall.sh"

dagger.sh
-Needs revision-
This is a makeself script for the installation of The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall. To create the self-extracting shell script:

Place the Daggerfall archive and dagger.sh in the same directory ("~/project/files" in this example). Make sure "dagger.sh" is executable.
From "~/project", execute the following: 'makeself makeself files/ daggerInstall.sh "Daggerfall Installer for Linux" ./dagger.sh'
You should now have an executable, self-extracting archive called "daggerInstall.sh"

view_edit.py
Intended to increase Daggerfall's viewing distance past its normal limit, this currently works but is extremely limited. It will only find a specific sequence of bytes instead of compensating for pixel-width changes in the options menu, and it will "only" double the viewing distance (I would like to add an option for additional distances). To be continued.
